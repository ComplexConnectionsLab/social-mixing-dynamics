  <figcaption><b>Income Triade Analysis: segregation dynamics</b> - 
(<b>A</b>)The income triad illustrates the distribution of three income groups: high, medium, and low. The triangle's vertices represent these groups, with colour intensity indicating neighbourhood density. A neighbourhood's position within the triangle shows its income group visitation pattern. Arrows indicate temporal segregation trends, with direction predicting future patterns and thickness denoting neighbourhood density with similar trends.
(<b>B</b>)Columns display segregation shifts across ALA clusters, while rows represent time bands: night-time, working hours, and evening leisure. Histograms beneath each triangle show the Gini coefficient segregation values for neighbourhoods within the same ALA cluster and time band.

(<b>C</b>) A dual-layered map, created using Python, highlights the most inclusive neighbourhoods on the top layer, with the bottom layer indicating segregation levels via a colour gradient. Hexagons from the top layer transition to light grey on the bottom, signifying low segregation.

## Introduction

This is a repository to accompany 'Time dynamics of income segregation at neighbourhood scale', under review in [Nature Cities]. It contains the code with the analyses of changes in the time-space dimension of income social mixing at neighbourhood scale. We capture the interplay of three different income groups (high, medium, and low) based on their daily routines. The three income groups define a novel three-dimensional space embedded in the temporal dynamics of urban activities, which we propose as a framework to analyse social mixing. This framework offers a more detailed perspective on social interactions, closely linked to the geographical features of each neighbourhood.
